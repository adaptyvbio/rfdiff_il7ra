## Contents
The data is structured as follows:
- "original_data": contains the data published on the RFDiffusion paper, including an additional kinetic report containing the kinetics and fitting provided by the Baker Lab.
- "affinity_characterization": contains the data generated by Adaptyv Bio for the experimental test case. The folder contains a summary of the kinetic data, figures containing the sensorgrams generated as well as the raw data.
